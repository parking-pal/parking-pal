# Parking Pal

## This is the parking pal app for downtown Kelowna

##Our final project is a web app, Parking Pal, which was inspired by the parking struggle in Kelowna.

Parking Pal connects home-owners empty driveways, who live close to down-town and commuters who work down-town. As a home-owner you can list your driveway for rental during weekdays(Monday-Friday) on a weekly or monthly basis, set a daily rental price and set a daily duration for the rental (ex: 8:00am-5:30pm).  

Commuters will search the available driveways through Google Maps API Satellite view and select a spot near their work that fancies their price range. Once an available driveway has been chosen by the commuter, they login, pay using Stripe, and voil√† they can then use that driveway for parking, for the agreed amount of time.

The app has the ability for home-owners or commuters to cancel the agreement, as well as an assumed auto renewal for the commuter renting the spot.

For our tech stack we used Bootstrap, Javascript, JQuery, HTML/CSS for the front end and Node.js, Handlebars for the framework and a PostGreSQL database.
We used this tech stack for a few reasons.
1. To learn some new techniques that we did not cover in the Lighthouse Labs course.
2. To utilize and implement API's (GoogleMaps, Stripe)
3. Ruby does not seem to be as popular a language in the Okanagan as it is in Vancouver, and we used ruby for our midterm project.

We purchased a domain, www.parkingpal.xyz and redirected it to Heroku.
